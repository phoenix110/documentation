[[using_screen_fragment_decl]]
Declarative usage of a fragment::
+
--
Suppose we have a fragment for entering an address:

.AddressFragment.java
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_fragment_1.java[]
----

.address-fragment.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_fragment_1.xml[]
----

Then we can include it to another screen using the `fragment` element with the `screen` attribute pointing to the fragment id, specified in its `@UiController` annotation:

.host-screen.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_host_1.xml[]
----

The `fragment` element can be added to any UI-container of the screen, including the top-level `layout` element.
--

[[using_screen_fragment_prog]]
Programmatic usage of a fragment::
+
--
The <<using_screen_fragment_decl,same fragment>> can be included in the screen programmatically in a <<screen_InitEvent,InitEvent>> or <<screen_AfterInitEvent,AfterInitEvent>> handler as follows:

.host-screen.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_host_2.xml[]
----

.HostScreen.java
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_host_2.java[]
----
<1> - inject the `Fragments` bean which is designed to instantiate screen fragments
<2> - create the fragment's controller by its class
<3> - initialize the screen fragment
<4> - get the `Fragment` visual component from the controller and add it to a UI-container


[WARNING]
====
Do not forget to initialize the screen fragment using the `init()` method after programmatic creation. If the fragment has parameters, you can set them via public setters prior to invoking `init()`. Then the parameters will be available in `InitEvent` and `AfterInitEvent` handlers of the fragment controller.
====

[[using_screen_fragment_data]]
Data components in screen fragments::
+
--
A screen fragment can have its own data containers and loaders, defined in the `data` XML element. At the same time, the framework creates a single instance of <<gui_DataContext,DataContext>> for the screen and all its fragments. Therefore all loaded entities are merged to the same context and their changes are saved when the host screen is committed.

In the following example, we consider usage of own data containers and loaders in a screen fragment.

Suppose we have a `City` entity and in the fragment, instead of the text field, we want to show a drop-down list with available cities. We can define data components in the fragment descriptor as we would in a regular screen:

.address-fragment.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_fragment_2.xml[]
----

In order to load data in the fragment when the host screen is opened, we need to subscribe to the screen's event:

.AddressFragment.java
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_fragment_2.java[]
----
<1> - subscribing to <<screen_BeforeShowEvent,BeforeShowEvent>> of the host screen

[WARNING]
====
The `@LoadDataBeforeShow` annotation does not work for screen fragments.
====
--

[[using_screen_fragment_provided_data]]
Provided data containers::
+
--
The next example demonstrates how to use data containers of the host screen in the fragment.

.host-screen.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_host_3.xml[]
----
<1> - data container which is used in the fragment below

.address-fragment.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_fragment_3.xml[]
----
<1> - `provided="true"` means that the container with the same id must exist in a host screen or enclosing fragment, i.e it must be provided from outside
<2> - UI-components are linked to the provided data container

In the XML element having `provided="true"`, all attributes except `id` are ignored but can be present to provide information for design time tools.
--

[[using_screen_fragment_host_events]]
Subscribing to host screen events::
+
--
In a fragment controller, you can subscribe to events of the host screen by specifying the `PARENT_CONTROLLER` value in the `target` attribute of the annotation, for example:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/fragment_screen_events_1.java[]
----

Any event can be handled this way, including <<screen_InitEntityEvent,InitEntityEvent>> sent by entity editors.
