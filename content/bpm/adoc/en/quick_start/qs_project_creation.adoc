=== Creating the Project
. Create a new project in CUBA Studio as described in the {studio_man_url}/create_project.html[Creating a New Project] section of the {studio_man_url}/index.html[CUBA Studio User Guide]:

* Project name: `bpm-demo`
* Project namespace: `demo`
* Root package: `com.company.bpmdemo`

[start=2]
. Open the *Project Properties* editor in CUBA Studio: click *CUBA > Project Properties* main menu item. Add the *bpm* application component in the *App components* list. Confirm when Studio suggests recreating Gradle scripts. Studio will download the required sources and binary {main_man_url}/glossary.html#artifact[artifacts]. You can also start the Gradle synchronization using the image:refresh_button.png[] button in the *Build* tool window.

. Create the database on the local *HyperSQL* server: select option *CUBA* > *Create database* in the main menu. The database name is the same as project namespace by default.

. Run the application: click the image:run_button.png[] button next to the selected `CUBA Application` configuration in the main toolbar. The link in the *Runs at...* section of the CUBA project tree will help to open the application in a web browser directly from Studio.

The username and password are `admin` / `admin`.

The running application contains two main menu items (*Administration* and *Help*), as well as {main_man_url}/security_subsystem.html[security] and administration subsystems functionality.
